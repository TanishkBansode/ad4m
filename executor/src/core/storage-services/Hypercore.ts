/*
    This service is responsible for creating and managing multiwrite/read hypercore drives for a given topic.
    It attempts to implement the following structure:
        - 1. Create a writer drive for the current agent, this is used to write to the network.
            Other users are expected to read from this drive. They will receive the key for this drive using mechanism 2.
        - 2. Create/join a swarm for sharing known drives, this is used to share the keys of all the drives in the network
            the unique topic ("seed") for this network is expected to be provided by the language calling this interface.
            Upon joining this swarm, we will receive a list of known drives for this topic from other agents in the network.
            The current agent will also send the list of known drives they have.
            Upon receiving a list of new known drives, the current agent will construct a new autobase drive and update the language via the provided callback
        - 3. Given the list of hypercore drives, create an autobase drive which will be given to the language to make any normal hyperdrive operations
