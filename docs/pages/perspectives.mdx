# Perspectives

A Perspective is essentially a **local graph database** that
contain the associations between [Expressions](/essentials/expressions).

While Expressions contain "objective data", Perspectives can associate meaning between Expressions
by linking them together.

## Creating a Perspective

Creating a new Perspective is easy:

```ts
const myNotes = ad4m.perspective.add("My private notes");
```

The returning object will be an instance of [PerspectiveProxy](/jsdoc/classes/PerspectiveProxy/)
â€“ which essentially will work as your database instance.

## Adding a Link

Perspectives only consist of a collection of **links**, which connect
three Expression URLs:

- **Subject**: The Expression that you want to store or retrieve information about.
- **Predicate**: Describes the relationship between the subject and the target.
- **Target**: The Expression that is connected to the subject.

```ts
const link = {
  subject: "did:key:zQ3shv5VUAbtY5P1jGsPzy7L27FTxeDv2hnhVp9QT3ALNCnQ2",
  predicate: "sioc://likes",
  target: "literal://ad4m",
};

myNotes.add(link);
```

## Query Links

We can query all links on a [PerspectiveProxy](/jsdoc/classes/PerspectiveProxy/) using the `get` function:

```js
const allLinks = await myNotes.get(
  new LinkQuery({ predicate: "sioc://likes" })
);
```

What you get back will be an array of [LinkExpressions](/jsdoc/classes/LinkExpression/):

```json
[
  {
    "author": "did:key:zQ3shv5VUAbtY5P1jGsPzy7L27FTxeDv2hnhVp9QT3ALNCnQ2",
    "timestamp": "2023-06-21T14:47:48.935Z",
    "data": {
      "subject": "did:key:zQ3shv5VUAbtY5P1jGsPzy7L27FTxeDv2hnhVp9QT3ALNCnQ2",
      "predicate": "sioc://likes",
      "target": "literal://ad4m"
    },
    "proof": {
      "key": "#zQ3shNWd4bg67ktTVg9EMnnrsRjhkH6cRNCjRRxfTaTqBniAf",
      "signature": "xxxx"
    }
  }
]
```

Even though this Perspective is not shared (yet) but just our private, local
graph database, we might want to share it as [Neighbourhood](/neighbourhoods).
