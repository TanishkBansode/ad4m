# Neighbourhoods

Neighbourhoods are essentially just [Perspectives](/perspectives) (graph databases) that are
shared and synced between Agents.

Every Neighborhood needs to use a **Link Language** to decide what technology it uses to store
the associations (links) between the Expressions.

Currently, there is one Link Language implemented called [Perspective Diff Sync](https://github.com/perspect3vism/perspective-diff-sync)
based on Holochain:

```js
const langs = await client.runtime.knownLinkLanguageTemplates();
console.log(langs[0]); // The uuid of the default Link Language
```

## Creating a Neighborhood

As mentioned before, the Link Language is responsible for storing and synchronizing
the links in a Neighborhood. If we want to avoid storing the links in the same
location as everyone else following this guide, we should create a duplicate of
the language. By giving it a unique ID, we can ensure that the links are saved
in a new and private network:

```js
const uniqueLinkLanguage = await ad4m.languages.applyTemplateAndPublish(
  langs[0],
  JSON.stringify({
    uuid: "84a329-77384c-1510fb",
    name: "Perspective Diff Sync clone",
  })
);
```

With that new Link Language, actually creating the Neighbourhood is simple.
We just have to provide the ID of the perspective we want to upgrade to a
Neighbourhood and the address of the Link Language:

```js
const meta = new Perspective();

const neighbourhoodUrl = await ad4m.neighbourhood.publishFromPerspective(
  myNotes.uuid,
  uniqueLinkLanguage.address,
  meta
);

console.log(neighbourhoodUrl); // => neighbourhood://Qm123456789abcdef
```

The `meta` field is a Perspective that is immutably stored with
the Neighbourhood. It can hold arbitrary meta information about the
Neighbourhood but can technically stay empty, just like we did here.

## Joining a Neighborhood

Assume everything above happened on Alice's agent. Alice now shares the Neighbourhood's URL with Bob.
This is what Bob does to join the Neigbourhood:

```js
const { uuid } = await ad4m.neighbourhood.joinFromUrl(neighbourhoodUrl);

const sharedNotes = await ad4m.perspective.byUUID(uuid);
```

Now Bob can read what used to be Alice's private notes:

```js
const links = await sharedNotes.get(
  new LinkQuery({
    predicate: "sioc://likes",
  })
);

links.forEach(async (link) => {
  const { data: who } = await ad4m.expression.get(link.source);
  const { data: what } = await ad4m.expression.get(link.target);
  console.log(who, "likes", what);
});
```
