# Agents

In ADAM, individuals are referred to as "Agents" instead of "Users" to
highlight their active role and contribution. They are not simply users who use the
network, but actively participate by operating as nodes, facilitating communication
and enhancing network security.

In the same way computers have their own unique IP address on the internet,
each agent in ADAM has their own [Decentralized Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier). Users can either use their
existing identity or create a new one:

```js
await ad4m.agent.generate("Password123");
```

To retrieve your own Decentralized Identifier (DID) you can call `me()` on the AgentClient:

```js
const { did, perspective } = await ad4m.agent.me();
```

Each Agent also has their own [Perspective](/essentials/perspectives) that can
contain public information about the Agent.
