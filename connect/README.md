# AD4M connection library and wizard for apps

This package makes it easy for AD4M apps to connect to a local or remote AD4M executor by handling all the complex things like finding the local executor port, requesting and storing a capability token, creating and recreating an Ad4mClient.

## In the Browser

```js
import Ad4mConnectUI from "@perspect3vism/ad4m-connect";

const ui = Ad4mConnect({
  appName: "Example",
  appDesc: "This is a sample app.",
  appDomain: "ad4m.dev",
  appIconPath: "https://i.ibb.co/GnqjPJP/icon.png",
  capabilities: [{ with: { domain: "*", pointers: ["*"] }, can: ["*"] }],
});

ui.addEventListener("authstatechange", (e) => {
  if (e.detail === "authenticated") {
    // We are authenticated
  }
});

// Open popup and save the client when we are done
ui.connect().then((client) => {
  // Save the client
});
```

## Usage (from Node / Electron)

Call ad4mConnect with parameters of your app:

```js
const { ad4mConnect } = require("@perspect3vism/ad4m-connect/electron");

ad4mConnect({
  // Provide the name of your app to be displayed in the dialog
  appName: "Perspect3ve",
  // Provide an icon to be displayed in the dialog as well
  appIconPath: path.join(__dirname, "graphics", "Logo.png"),
  // Name the capabilities your app needs
  // (this is an example with all capabilities)
  capabilities: [{ with: { domain: "*", pointers: ["*"] }, can: ["*"] }],
  // Provide a directory in which the capability token and the executor
  // URL will be stored such that future calls won't even open a dialog
  // but try the token against that URL and resolve immediately
  // if it works.
  dataPath: path.join(homedir(), ".perspect3ve"),
})
  .then(({ client, capabilityToken, executorUrl }) => {
    // Retrieved `capabilityToken` and selected `executorUrl` are returned
    // but all that is really needed is `client` which is a fully setup
    // (including capability token) and working Ad4mClient.
    //
    // Both, the URL and the token have already been stored on disk
    // in the directory provided as `dataPath`.
    //
    // Consequetive calls
    createWindow(client);
  })
  .catch(() => {
    console.log("User closed AD4M connection wizard. Exiting...");
    app.exit(0);
    process.exit(0);
  });
```
